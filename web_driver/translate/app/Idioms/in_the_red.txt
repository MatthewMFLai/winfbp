In the Red

The letter came out of the blue! I wasn't expecting it. But there it was in black and white, signed by the bank manager. I had no money in my checking account. I was in the red.

I couldn't believe it. So I went to see the manager. We looked at the problem together. The bank had made a mistake. It had put ten dollars into my account instead of one thousand dollars!

Because it was the bank's mistake, there was no delay reopening my account. The manager cut through all the red tape. Now I had money in my account. And I had the green light to write checks again.

out of the blue : by surprise, unexpectedly
in black and white: very clear and easy to understand
in the red : owing money, in debt
red tape : complicated official procedures and forms
green light : the okay to start something
the red carpet : special honors for a special or important person
the black market : the market not controlled by the government, where things are sold in private and often against the law
a white lie : something that's not true but that causes no harm
green with envy : jealous of someone else's good fortune
to feel blue : to feel sad
