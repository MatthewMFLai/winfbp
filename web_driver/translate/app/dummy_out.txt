Twenty-seven-year-old Randy Bova has his loyal Border-Aussie Bailey to thank for his life. As his beautiful home in Guilford, Connecticut went up in flames, it was Baily who came to the rescue, alerting(向……報警；使警覺；使注意[（+to）]) his owner that something was awry(錯).

Randy and Bailey were the only Bova family members home on June 25, 2016, in the house they share with Randy’s mother Lucy and younger brother Robert. Randy was listening to music in his bedroom when the fire started on the opposite side of the house. Bailey rushed(匆忙的) to his door and began barking erratically(不定地；怪異地), something that Randy recalls was uncharacteristic(不典型的，不尋常的). Piqued(刺激，激起（好奇心等)) by her strange(奇怪的，奇妙的，不可思議的) behavior, Randy followed her downstairs to find the entire first floor filled with smoke.

Frightened, Bailey darted(猛衝，飛奔[S]) into her kennel(狗舍[C]), but Randy acted quickly. “Thankfully, Randy was able to grab Bailey and make it out the back door,” said Randy’s brother, Robert Bova.

Only once outside did Randy realize(領悟，了解，認識到[+（that）][+wh-]) the severity(猛烈；凜冽；嚴重[U]) of the fire; they had escaped(逃脫,避開,溜走) just in time to discover(發現[U][C][（+of）][+that]) the scorched(焦) remains of his childhood home. “The truth is that Bailey was just very easy to train, she’s a very special and bright dog. I’ve always loved her, but now I owe my life to her as well,” Randy wrote in a post on Facebook.

Robert Bova started a GoFundMe account(帳，帳目，帳單[C]) to raise(籌（款）；招（兵）；集結) money for his family’s expenses, and Robert says he has been overwhelmed(使受不了；使不知所措[H][（+by/with）]) by the response(回答；答覆[C][（+to）]) of family, friends, and strangers(陌生人[（+to）]). “It is a unique(唯一的，獨一無二的；獨特的[Z][（+to）]) feeling of sorrow(悲痛，悲哀，悲傷，憂傷[U][（+at/for/over）]) when you lose the house you grew up in. It feels as if both my brother’s childhood memories and mine can never be replaced.” Robert wrote on the GoFundMe page. “But we are extremely(極端地；極其；非常) happy everyone is healthy and safe.”

As for the heroic(英雄的，英勇的) pooch(【美】【俚】雜種狗)? “Bailey has been receiving a lot of attention(注意；注意力；專心[U]) since the incident(事件；事變[C]),” Randy says. “She relishes(喜愛，愛好[+v-ing]) being in the spotlight(公眾注意的中心[the S]).”
