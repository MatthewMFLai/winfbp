Fable 34

The Shepherd(牧羊人) and the Wolf Cubs(幼獸)

A shepherd found some wolf cubs and he brought them up, thinking that the fully grown wolves would both guard his flock(羊群) and steal(偷，竊取) other people's sheep to bring back to his sheepfold(羊欄). But when the cubs grew up, the first thing they did was to destroy(殺死，消滅) the man's own flock. The man groaned(呻吟聲；哼聲) and said, 'It serves me right(活該)! Why didn't I kill them when they were little?'

[The story shows that when people harbour(藏匿) a criminal they become his first victims(犧牲者，遇難者) without even realizing(領悟，了解) it.]

Note: Compare the Greek proverb(諺語，俗語，常言), 'It is better not to raise a lion cub'
