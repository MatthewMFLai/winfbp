Fable 47

The Stag(成年雄鹿), the Horse, and the Man

There was a horse who was the sole(唯一的，單一的) owner of a meadow(草地，牧場). Then a stag came and wreaked(造成，引起) havoc(破壞，毀壞；混亂) in the meadow. The horse wanted to get revenge(報仇；報復), so he asked a certain man if he would help him carry out a vendetta(宿怨) against the stag. The man agreed, provided that the horse took the bit(（馬）嚼口；馬勒) in his mouth so that the man could ride him, wielding(揮舞) his javelin(標槍). The horse consented(許可，允許；同意) and the man climbed on his back, but instead(反而，卻) of getting his revenge, the horse simply became a slave(奴隸) to the man.
