Fable 49

The Swans(天鵝) and the Geese(鵝)

Some swans and some geese became friends and went out onto the meadows(草地). As they were feeding contentedly(高興；滿足) together, they were discovered(發現) by hunters(獵人). The swans, owing to(因為) the swiftness(迅速的，敏捷的) of their bodies, were immediately able to take wing(起飛) and fly away. The geese, however, were naturally more heavy and so they were left behind and caught by the hunters.
