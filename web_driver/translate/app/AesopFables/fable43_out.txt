Fable 43

The Eagle(鷹) and the Arrow(箭)

[A story about an archer(弓箭手), showing that it is bitter(使人痛苦的) to be betrayed(背叛，出賣) by one of your own.]

An archer aimed(瞄準，對準) at an eagle and let loose(射（箭）) an arrow. The eagle was struck, and as he turned and looked at the shaft(桿，柄) which was tipped(末梢，末端，尖) with his own feathers(羽毛), he said, 'Many are betrayed by the very things that they themselves have wrought(使發生).'
