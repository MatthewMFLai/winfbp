Fable 76

The Panther(黑豹) and the People

A panther foolishly(愚蠢的) happened to have fallen into a pit(坑). The local villagers(村民) saw her there and some of them attacked her with sticks or pelted her with stones. There were others who felt sorry for the creature(動物) since she seemed sure to die even though she had not done any harm, so they brought her bread to keep up her strength(體力). Night fell and everyone went home, confident(確信的) that they would find the panther dead when the next day dawned(黎明). However, as soon as she recovered(（尤指健康）失而復得) from her weakness and regained(恢復) her strength, the panther escaped(逃脫) from the pit with a mighty(強大的) leap(跳) and hurried quickly home to her den(巢穴). A few days later she descended(突然襲擊) upon the village, slaughtering(殺戮) the sheep and even killing the shepherds as she laid waste to everything around her in a furious(怒不可遏) attack of rage(暴怒). At this point even the people who had shown mercy(憐憫) to the beast began to fear what lay in store for them. Without a word about the damage(破壞) that the panther had wrought(使發生), they begged her just to spare(饒恕) their lives. The panther then said, 'I am well aware(明白的) of who pelted(連續投擲) me with stones and who gave me bread(麵包), so put aside your fears. I have returned as an enemy(敵人) only to those who wanted to hurt me.'
