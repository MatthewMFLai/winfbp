Fable 85

Diogenes and the Ferryman(渡船夫)

On his travels, Diogenes the Cynic came to a stream that was flooded(被水淹沒的). He stood on the bank(堤，岸), unable to go any further. One of those ferrymen who regularly carry people across rivers saw that Diogenes did not know what to do, so he approached(靠近) the philosopher(哲學家), picked him up, and kindly carried him across the water. Diogenes then stood on the opposite shore, bewailing(哀嘆) the poverty(貧困) that prevented(阻止) him from rewarding the man for his good deed. While Diogenes was still pondering(衡量) this state of affairs, the ferryman saw another traveller who could not get across, so he hurried off to offer(主動給予) his assistance(幫助). Diogenes accosted(走近談話) the ferryman and said, 'Well, I do not feel in your debt(債務) any longer for the favour(好處) that you did me. This is not an act of judgement(判斷) on your part -- it's an addiction(使人上癮的)!'

[The story shows that someone who assists both the truly good and those who are undeserving(不配受到的) is not seen as a philanthropist(慈善家), but is instead regarded as a madman(瘋子).]

NOTE: Diogenes the Cynic was a Greek mendicant(托缽僧) philosopher of the fourth century BCE. For another anecdote(軼事) about Diogenes, see Fable 580]
