Fable 89

The Birds, the Peacock(孔雀), and His Feathers(羽毛)

The peacock was a remarkable(非凡的) bird, both because of the beauty(美麗) of his feathers with their various(各種不同的) colours and also because he was gentle(和藹的) and courteous(有禮貌的). On his way to the assembly(聚集) of the birds, the peacock ran into the raven(度鴉). The raven asked the peacock if he would give him two of his feathers. The peacock said, 'What will you do for me in return?' The raven replied, 'I will squawk(嘎嘎叫) your praises(表揚) throughout(在各處) the courts in the presence(面前) of all the other birds!' So the peacock gave the raven two of his feathers. The crow(烏鴉) then made the same request(請求) of the peacock and obtained two of the peacock's feathers, as did the cuckoo(杜鵑) and all kinds of other birds, until finally the peacock was plucked(拔去) completely bare(光禿禿的). The peacock was supposed(應該) to nourish(養育) and protect his chicks(雛鳥) but he was unable to do so since he didn't have any feathers. Winter came, and he died. His chicks went away and lived as best as they could on their own.
