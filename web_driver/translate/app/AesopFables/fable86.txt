Fable 86

The Wolf, the Fox, and the Gift

A fox was standing not far away from a trap, pondering every possible approach. A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox replied, 'Go ahead and help yourself! You're welcome to it, seeing as you are one of my very dearest friends.' The wolf rushed up without a moment's hesitation, and as he leaned forward over the trap he released the trigger so that the rod sprang free, striking his snout and forehead. 'If this is the sort of gift you give to your friends,' said the wolf, 'why would anyone ever want to be friends with you?'
