Fable 59

The Two Bulls(公牛) and the Lion(獅子)

A lion was attacking(襲擊) two bulls, hoping to make a meal(餐) of them. The bulls, however, both opposed(反抗) the lion with their horns(角). Once they had taken their stand(抵抗), the bulls did not allow the lion to come between them. When the lion saw that he was powerless(無力量的) against the two bulls together, he slyly(狡猾的) spoke to one of them and said, 'If you hand your partner over to me, I will keep you safe(安全的) from harm(傷害).' In this way, he was able to seize(抓住) both of the bulls.

[The fable shows that the same is true of cities and people: when they are in agreement(意見一致) with one another, they do not allow their enemies(敵人) to defeat(擊敗) them, but if they refuse(拒絕) to cooperate(合作), it is an easy matter(情勢) for their enemies to destroy(摧毀) them.]
