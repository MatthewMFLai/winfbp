Fable 40

eus and the Oak Trees

Once upon a time the oak trees came to Zeus and lodged a complaint. 'O Zeus, founder of our species and father of all plant life, if it is our destiny to be chopped down, why did you even cause us to grow?' Zeus smiled and replied, 'It is you yourselves who supply the means of your destruction: if you didn't create all the handles, no farmer would have an axe in his house!'

[There is a similar Greek proverb, 'The ox supplies his own whip']
