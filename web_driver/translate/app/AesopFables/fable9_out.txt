Fable 9

The Butcher(屠夫), the Shepherd(牧羊人，羊倌), and the Lamb

A shepherd and a butcher were walking along the road together. They saw a plump(豐滿的；胖嘟嘟的) little lamb who had wandered(迷路) away from the flock(羊群；（飛禽，牲畜等的）群) and had been left behind by his fellow(同伴的；同事的；同類的) sheep(羊，綿羊). The shepherd and the butcher both rushed(匆忙的) to grab(攫取，抓取) the lamb. This was back in the days when animals spoke the same language(語言；語言文字) as people, so the lamb asked the two men why they wanted to grab him and carry him off. After the lamb found out what they both did, he turned and offered(提供,奉獻,提議提供,奉獻,提議) himself to the shepherd. 'You are nothing but an executioner(劊子手；死刑執行者) of sheep(羊，綿羊),' he said to the butcher, 'and your hands are stained(玷汙的) with the blood(血，血液) of the flock! This man, on the other hand, rejoices(欣喜，高興) if we thrive(興旺，繁榮；成功) and prosper(繁榮，昌盛；成功).'
