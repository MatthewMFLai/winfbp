Fable 44

The Decoys and the Doves

A bird-catcher laid out his net, tying some tame doves to the net as decoys. He then stood off at a distance, waiting to see what would happen. Some wild doves flew up to the tame doves and became entangled in the knots of the net. When the bird-catcher ran up and began to grab them, the wild doves were angry at the tame doves, since the tame doves had not warned them about the trap even though they were all members of the same species. The tame doves replied, 'Nevertheless, it is better for us to protect the interests of our masters than to please our relations.'

[The same is true about household servants: they should not be blamed when their devotion to the master of the house causes them to set aside any loyalty to their kinfolk.]
