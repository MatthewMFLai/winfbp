Fable 78

The Sheep, the Shepherd, and His Cloak

A shepherd had driven his sheep into a stand of oaks. He then spread his cloak under an oak tree and climbed up into the tree in order to shake the acorns down. As the sheep ate the acorns, they also ate the shepherd's cloak, unbeknownst to the shepherd. The shepherd then climbed down from the tree, and when he saw what had happened he said, 'Oh you wicked creatures! You give wool to other people so that they can make clothes but you take my clothes and ruin them, even though I am the one who feeds you!"

[The fable shows that people frequently do favours for someone who has nothing to do with them, while treating their own family members unkindly.]
