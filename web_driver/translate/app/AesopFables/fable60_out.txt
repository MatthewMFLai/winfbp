Fable 60

The Dogs and Their Commander(指揮官)

During the war of the dogs and the wolves, the dog-assembly chose an Achaean(阿該亞人) to be their commander. Although he was an expert in the art of war, the commander waited and delayed(延誤的). With fierce(猛烈的) threats, the dogs urged(敦促) him to advance and engage(（與…）開戰) in battle but the commander explained, 'Here is the reason why I delay and act with caution(謹慎)! One must always make plans with an eye to the future. All of the enemy whom I have seen are wolves, members of the same breed, whereas(但是) some of us are dogs from Crete, some are Molossian hounds(獵犬), some are Acarnanians, others are Dolopians, while others boast(誇耀) of being from Cyprus or Thrace. Still others come from other places - what need is there to go on at length? We are not even the same colour, as the wolves are: some of us are black, some are grey, some are red with white-spotted chests, and some of us are white all over. How can I lead troops who are so lacking in unity(一致；團結) to fight against an enemy who all resemble(看起來像) each other in every possible way?'

[Note: An epimythium(寓意) probably added by a later editor reads: 'Unity is mankind's greatest good, while dissension(分歧，異議) is a weak and slavish(盲從的) thing.' Molossians and the other dogs listed here were breeds(品種) who took their name from their place of origin (like German shepherds, Rhodesian ridgebacks, etc. today).]
