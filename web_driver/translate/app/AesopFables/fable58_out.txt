Fable 58

The Butcher(屠夫) and the Flock(羊群)

[Relatives and friends who cannot agree with one another will come to a bad end, as the following fable tells us.]

Some castrated(閹割) sheep had been gathered together in a flock with the rams(公羊). Although the sheep realized that the butcher ahd come into the flock, they pretended(假裝的) not to see him. Even when they saw one of their own seized(抓住) by the butcher's deadly hands and taken away to be slaughtered(屠宰), still the sheep were not afraid. Foolishly(愚蠢的), they said to one another, 'He keeps his hands off me, he keeps his hands off you; let him take whom he takes.' In the end, there was only one sheep left. This is what he reportedly(據傳聞) said to the butcher when he saw that he too was about to be taken away: 'We deserve(值得) to be slaughtered one after another since we didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. The fact is, as soon as we saw you here in our midst(當中), back when we were all together, we should haved killed you at once by smashing(猛撞) you between our horns(角).'

[This fable shows that people who do not keep an eye out for their own safety will be utterly(徹底的) destroyed(摧毀) by evil.]
