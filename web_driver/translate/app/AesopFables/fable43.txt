Fable 43

The Eagle and the Arrow

[A story about an archer, showing that it is bitter to be betrayed by one of your own.]

An archer aimed at an eagle and let loose an arrow. The eagle was struck, and as he turned and looked at the shaft which was tipped with his own feathers, he said, 'Many are betrayed by the very things that they themselves have wrought.'
