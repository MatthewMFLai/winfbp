Fable 77

The Dog and the Gardener(花匠)

A gardener had a dog who had fallen into a well(水井). The gardener lowered(降下) himself into the well to pull the dog out, but the dog only gave the man a nasty(惡意的) bite, thinking that the man intended(故意的) to plunge(（使）投入) him even deeper into the water. After the dog had bitten him, the gardener said, 'It serves me right for making such an effort(盡力) to pull you out of the well, when all you can do is attack(襲擊) me.'
