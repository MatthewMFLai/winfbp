Fable 35

The Shepherd and the Wolf Cub

A shepherd found a little wolf cub and raised it. Then, when the cub was bigger he taught it to steal from his neighbours' flocks. Once he had learned how to do this, the wolf said to the shepherd, 'Now that you have shown me how to steal, take care that many of your own sheep don't go missing!'

[The fable shows that people who are vicious by nature will often injure
their teachers once they have been taught to steal and be greedy.]
