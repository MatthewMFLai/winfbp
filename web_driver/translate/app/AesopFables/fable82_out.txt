Fable 82

The Travellers and the Plane Tree(篠懸木)

Around noon on a summer's day, some travellers who were exhausted(精疲力竭的) by the heat caught sight of a plane tree. They went and lay down in the shade(陰涼處) of the tree in order to rest. Looking up at the tree, they remarked(談到) to one another that the plane tree produced no fruit and was therefore useless(無用的) to mankind(人類). The plane tree interrupted(中斷的) them and said, 'What ungrateful(不感激的) people you are! You denounce(痛斥) my uselessness and lack(缺少) of fruit at the very moment in which you are enjoying my kindness!'

[Likewise(同樣), even when a person treats his neighbours(鄰居) well, his goodness can unfortunately be called into question(對...表示懷疑).]
