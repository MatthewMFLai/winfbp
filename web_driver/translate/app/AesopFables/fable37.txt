Fable 37

The Blind Man and the Cub

There was a blind man who was in the habit of identifying any animal that was placed in his hands by touching it. Once they gave him a wolf cub. Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its identity, so he said, 'I am not sure whether it is the cub of a wolf or a fox or some similar creature, but I do know that this is not the kind of animal that should accompany a flock of sheep!'

[In the same way bad people are revealed by their feathers.]
