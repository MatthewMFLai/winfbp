Fable 53

The Goose(鵝) and the Stork(鸛)

A stork had gone to her usual pond and saw a goose there who kept plunging(猛降的) down deep into the water. The stork then asked the goose what she was doing and the goose replied, 'We geese go down into the muddy(泥濘的) bottom of the pond(池塘) to look for food and to escape the hawk(鷹)'s attack(襲擊).' The stork said, 'I am stronger than the hawk! You should be friends with me, and I will allow you to scoff(嘲笑) at that other bird!' The goose agreed, and not long afterwards(後來) she called on the stork to come help her. The goose had not plunged into the water, so the hawk immediately(直接地) swooped(俯衝) down and caught her up in his talons(爪). As the hawk was about to devour(吞食) here, the goose replied, 'A wretched(苦惱的；不幸的) death awaits anyone who puts his trust in such a worthless(無價值的) defender(守衛者)!'

[For people who expect to be defended by someone who cannot offer them any protection.]
