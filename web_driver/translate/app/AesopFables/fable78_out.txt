Fable 78

The Sheep, the Shepherd, and His Cloak(披風)

A shepherd had driven his sheep into a stand of oaks(橡樹). He then spread his cloak under an oak tree and climbed up into the tree in order to shake the acorns(橡子) down. As the sheep ate the acorns, they also ate the shepherd's cloak, unbeknownst(在（某人）不知道的情況下) to the shepherd. The shepherd then climbed down from the tree, and when he saw what had happened he said, 'Oh you wicked(缺德的) creatures(生物)! You give wool(羊毛) to other people so that they can make clothes but you take my clothes and ruin(毀壞) them, even though I am the one who feeds you!"

[The fable shows that people frequently do favours(恩惠) for someone who has nothing to do with them, while treating(對待) their own family members unkindly(刻薄的).]
