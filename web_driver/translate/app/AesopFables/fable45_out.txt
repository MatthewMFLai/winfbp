Fable 45

The Bird-catcher and the Partridge(鷓鴣，山鶉)

A bird-catcher had captured(俘虜；俘獲) a partridge and was ready to strangle(扼死，勒死，掐死) her right there on the spot. The partridge wanted to save her life so she pleaded(乞求，懇求) with the bird-catcher and said, 'If you release(釋放，放走) me from this snare(陷阱，羅網), I will lure(引誘，誘惑，誘導) many partridges here and bring them to you.' The bird-catcher was made even more angry by this and he killed the partridge immediately(立即，即刻，馬上).

[The fable shows that someone who lays(準備，安排；擬定) a trap for others will fall victim(受害者，受騙者，受災者) to it himself.]
