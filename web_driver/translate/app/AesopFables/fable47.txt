Fable 47

The Stag, the Horse, and the Man

There was a horse who was the sole owner of a meadow. Then a stag came and wreaked havoc in the meadow. The horse wanted to get revenge, so he asked a certain man if he would help him carry out a vendetta against the stag. The man agreed, provided that the horse took the bit in his mouth so that the man could ride him, wielding his javelin. The horse consented and the man climbed on his back, but instead of getting his revenge, the horse simply became a slave to the man.
