Fable 61

The Lion and the Boar(野豬) at the Spring(泉)

In summertime, when the heat makes everyone thirsty, a lion and a wild boar had come to drink from the same small spring. They began to argue about who was going to take the first drink, and their argument escalated(（使）惡化) into a duel(決鬥) to the death. When they momentarily(短暫地) paused(暫停) to catch their breath(氣息), the lion and the boar saw that vultures(禿鷲) were waiting to snatch(搶走) and devour(吞食) the one who was killed. At that point, the lion and the boar put their hatred(敵意) aside and said, 'It is better for us to befriend(對（某人）友好) one another than to be eaten by vultures and ravens(度鴉)!'

[The story teaches us that it is good to set aside our deadly disputes(爭執) and conflicts(衝突), since they put everyone's lives in jeopardy(處於危險之中).]
