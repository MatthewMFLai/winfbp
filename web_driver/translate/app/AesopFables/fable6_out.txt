Fable 6

The Donkey, the Priests(神職人員；教士；僧人；祭司), and the Tambourines(鈴鼓，手鼓)

The Galli, those priests(神職人員；教士；僧人；祭司) of the goddess(女神) Cybebe, used a donkey to carry their luggage(【主英】行李) when they went around begging(乞討) for alms(施舍（物），救濟（品）；施舍金). When their donkey finally died, overcome(壓倒) by work and the whip, they stripped(剝，剝去，剝光) his hide(獸皮；皮革) and made themselves some tambourines(鈴鼓，手鼓). When someone asked them what they had done with their darling donkey, the priests(神職人員；教士；僧人；祭司) replied, 'He thought that once he died he would get some rest, but he keeps on getting beaten(挨打的) just the same!'

[It is not enough that a man who is born(出生的，誕生的；產生的) under an unlucky star leads an unhappy life; the bitter afflication(苦惱，折磨) of his fate(命運；天命，天數) pursues(（疾病等）糾纏；跟隨) him even after he is dead.]
