fable 69

The Shepherd and the Lion

While he was wandering in the fields, a lion got a thorn stuck in his paw. He immediately went to a shepherd, wagging his tail as he said, 'Don't be afraid! I have come to ask your help. I'm not looking for food.' The lion then lifted his paw and placed it in the man's lap. 'The shepherd pulled out the thorn from the lion's paw and the lion went back into the woods. Later on, the shepherd was falsely accused of a crime and at the next public games he was released from jail and thrown to the beasts. As the wild animals rushed upon him from all sides, the lion recognized that this was the same man who had healed him. Once again the lion raised his paw and placed it in the shepherd's lap. When the king understood what had happened, he commanded that the lion be spared and that the gentle shepherd be sent back home to his family.

[When a man acts righteously, he can never be defeated by the punishments inflicted on him by his enemies.]
