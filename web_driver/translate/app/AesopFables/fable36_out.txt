Fable 36

The Shepherd, the Wolf Cub, and the Wolf

A shepherd found a newborn(新出生的) wolf cub. Taking it home, he raised(養育) it with his dogs. After the cub had grown up, he would join(連結；使結合) the dogs in the chase(追逐；追捕；追蹤) if a prowling(（野獸等）四處覓食；暗中來回尋覓) wolf ever stole one of the sheep. When the dogs were no longer able to keep up with the other wolf and turned back for home (as sometimes happened), the wolf would continue(繼續，持續；延伸) the chase until he caught the other wolf and received an equal share of the prey(被捕食的動物), true to his wolf's nature(天性；性質；本質). Then he too would go back home. If, however, no wolves came to seize(抓住；捉住) the sheep, he would secretly(祕密地；背地裡) slaughter(屠宰) one of the sheep and eat it together with the dogs. When the shepherd finally guessed(猜測；推測) what was happening, he hanged(絞死；吊死) the wolf from a tree and killed(殺死) him.

[The fable shows that a wicked(壞的；缺德的；邪惡的) nature does not produce a good character(（人的）品質；性格).]
