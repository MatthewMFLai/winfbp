Fable 29

The Hedgehog(【動】蝟，刺蝟), the Fox(狐), and the Ticks(壁蝨)

Aesop was defending a demagogue(蠱惑民心的政客，煽動家) at Samos who was on trial(審訊的；審判的) for his life when he told this story: 'A fox was crossing a river but she got swept by the current into a gully(水溝，溝渠). A long time passed and she couldn't get out. Meanwhile, there were ticks swarming(被擠滿；群集) all over the fox's body, making her quite miserable(痛苦的；不幸的). A hedgehog wandered(漫遊；閒逛；流浪；徘徊) by and happened to see the fox. He took pity(憐憫；同情) on her and asked if he should remove the ticks, but the fox refused. The hedgehog asked the reason why, and the fox replied, "These ticks have taken their fill of me and are barely(僅僅，勉強；幾乎沒有) sucking my blood at this point, but if you take these ticks away, others will come and those hungry new ticks will drink up all the blood I have left!" And the same is true for you, people of Samos: this man will do you no harm(損傷，傷害；危害) since he is already wealthy, but if you condemn(宣告……有罪，判……刑) him to death, others will come who do not have any money, and they will rob(搶劫，劫掠，盜取) you blind(隱蔽的，難以察覺的)!'
