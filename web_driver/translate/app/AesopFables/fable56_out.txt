Fable 56

The Bear(熊), the Lion, and the Fox Go Hunting(打獵)

The bear, the lion and the fox went hunting together. While the lion and the bear tracked(追蹤) down their prey(獵物) by their own efforts, the fox instead found a camel(駱駝) who had been tied(縛) to a post(柱). She then went and told her companions(同伴) that this was something they could catch.
