Fable 64

The Donkey(驢) and the Mule(騾子)

A donkey and a mule were walking along together. When the donkey saw that they were carrying equal(相等的) loads, he got angry and complained(抱怨) that the mule was awarded(授予) a double portion(部分) of food even though she carried a load that was no bigger than his own. After they had journeyed(旅行) a little further down the road, the driver saw that the donkey could not hold up(承受) under the weight, so he took part of the donkey's load and placed it on the mule. Later, when the driver saw that the donkey had grown even more tired(疲倦的), he again transferred(搬) some of the donkey's load to the mule, and so on. Finally the driver took the entire(全部的) load and shifted(轉移) it from the donkey to the mule. At that point the mule glanced(一瞥) over at the donkey and said, 'What do you say now: don't I deserve(應得) a double portion of food?'

[It is the same when we pass judgement(作出裁判) on one another's situations(處境): instead of looking at how things start, we should look instead at how they turn out(成為) in the end.]
