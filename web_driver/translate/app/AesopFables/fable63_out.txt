Fable 63

The Snake(蛇), the Weasel(黃鼠狼), and the Mice(鼠)

A snake and a weasel were fighting with one another inside a house. The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted(受到追捕的) down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the weasel fighting with each other, they emerged(出現) from their holes and scurried(碎步快跑) around. When the weasel and the snake saw what was happening, they stopped fighting with each other and turned their attention(注意力) to the mice.
