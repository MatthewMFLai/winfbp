Fable 30

The Wolves and the Dogs

The wolves wanted to make friends with the dogs, so they said, 'Since we have so much in common(共同的，共有的), why don't you treat(對待) us as your brothers and friends? It is merely(只是，僅僅，不過) our attitude(態度，意見，看法) that divides(使對立，分裂) us. We wolves all live a life of freedom, while you dogs are the slaves of people who make you wear collars(（狗等的）頸圈) around your necks and who beat you with sticks whenever it pleases(使高興，使喜歡，使滿意) them. And that is not your only hardship(艱難，困苦): you even have to guard their flocks(羊群) and, what's worse, when they are eating their dinner, they toss(拋，扔，投) you nothing but the bones as your share. If you will agree to our bargain(協議), you can turn everything over to us and we'll eat our fill together.' Right away the dogs agreed, so the wolves attacked the flock and killed the dogs, so that the flock could not call out for help against the wolves.

[The fable shows that these are the wages(代價；報償) of people who betray(背叛；出賣) their country.]
