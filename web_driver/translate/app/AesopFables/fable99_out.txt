Fable 99

The Bull(公牛), the Lion, and the Dinner Invitation(邀請)

There was once a lion who wanted to set a trap for a wild bull. He pretended(假裝的) to be making a sacrifice to the mother of the gods and asked the bull to come share the feast. The bull said that he would come, suspecting(懷疑) nothing(沒什麼). But when he arrived and stood in the lion's door, he looked and saw many bronze(青銅) cooking pots filled with boiling water, along with cleavers(剁肉刀) and knives for skinning(剝皮), all newly polished(磨光的). yet the bull didn't see anything that could be offered for sacrifice(獻祭) except a single trussed-up (翅膀和腳紮攏) rooster(公雞). The bull then turned tail(逃跑) and ran back to the mountains. Later on the lion happened to run into the bull and criticized(批評) his behaviour. The bull said, 'I came to your house, and here's the proof that I was there: you had no sacrificial victim on hand that was equal to the scale of your butcher(屠宰) shop.'
