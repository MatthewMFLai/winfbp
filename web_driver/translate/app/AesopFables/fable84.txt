Fable 84

The Man, the Mare, and the Foal

A man was riding a pregnant mare and she gave birth to her foal while they were still on the road.  The newborn foal followed directly behind his mother but soon became unsteady on his feet. The foal then said to the man, 'Look, you can see that I am very small and not strong enough to travel. If you leave me here, I am sure to die. But if you carry me away from here back to your home and bring me up, then later on, when I am grown, I shall let you ride me.'

[The fable shows that we should do favours for someone who can do us a good deed in return.]
