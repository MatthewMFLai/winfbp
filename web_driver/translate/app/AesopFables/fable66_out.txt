Fable 66

The Stomach(胃) and the Body

Back when all the parts of the human body did not function in unison(一致) as is the case today, each member(成員) of the body had its own opinion(主張) and was able to speak(說話). The various(各種各樣的) members were offended(觸怒) that everything won by their hard work and diligent(勤勞的) efforts was delivered(運送) to he stomach while he simply sat there in their midst(當中), fully at ease(舒適，安逸，自在) and just enjoying the delights(樂趣) that were brought to him. Finally, the members of the body revolted(造反): the hands refused(拒絕) to bring food to the mouth, the mouth refused to take in any food, and the teeth refused to chew(咀嚼) anything. In their angry effort to subdue(壓制) the stomach with hunger(饑餓感), the various parts of the body and the whole body itself completely wasted(被浪費掉的) away. As a result, they realized(領悟) that the work done by the stomach was no small matter, and that the food he consumed was no more than what he gave back to all the parts of the body in the form of blood which allows us to flourish(蓬勃發展) and thrive(茁壯成長), since the stomach enriches(使豐富) the blood with digested(消化) food and then distributes(分發) it equally throughout(在各處) the veins(靜脈).

[Note: In Plutarch, Life of Coriolanus 6, the stomach puts a stop to the foolish(愚蠢的) body parts by laughing at them. There is nothing funny about the medieval(中世紀) Latin versions of the fable, in which the protest(抗議) reaches its logical conclusion(結局) and the entire body dies of hunger. This story is perhaps best-known from the version(版本) found in the opening scene(（戲劇的）一場) of Shakespeare's Coriolanus.]
