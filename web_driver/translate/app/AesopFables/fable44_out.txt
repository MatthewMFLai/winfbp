Fable 44

The Decoys(誘餌，圈套) and the Doves(鴿子)

A bird-catcher laid out his net, tying some tame doves to the net as decoys. He then stood off at a distance, waiting to see what would happen. Some wild(野生的) doves flew up to the tame(溫順的，馴化的) doves and became entangled(纏住，套住) in the knots(（繩等的）結；（裝飾用的）花結；蝴蝶結) of the net. When the bird-catcher ran up and began to grab(攫取；抓住；抓取) them, the wild doves were angry at the tame doves, since the tame doves had not warned(警告；告誡；提醒) them about the trap(陷阱，羅網，捕捉器) even though they were all members(成員，一分子) of the same species(種，物種). The tame doves replied, 'Nevertheless(儘管如此), it is better for us to protect the interests(利益，好處) of our masters than to please our relations(關係，聯繫，交往).'

[The same is true about household servants(僕人，佣人，僱工): they should not be blamed(責備；責怪；歸咎於) when their devotion(忠誠，忠實；摯愛) to the master of the house causes them to set aside any loyalty(忠誠，忠實) to their kinfolk(家屬，親屬).]
