Fable 72

The Snake, the Eagle, and the Farmer

[A story about an eagle and a snake, exhorting(規勸) us to be the first to grant(授予) a favour.]

A snake and an eagle were grappling(扭打) with one another as they fought. The snake had tightened(緊固) his hold on the eagle when a farmer saw them and freed the eagle from the grip(緊握) of the snake. The snake was angry about what had happened, so he went and poisoned(毒) the man's drinking water. But just as the unsuspecting(無戒備之心的) farmer was about to take a drink, the eagle flew down and snatched(搶走) the cup out of his hands.
