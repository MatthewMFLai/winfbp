Fable 55

The Dolphin and the Lion

A lion was wandering on the seashore when he saw a dolphin stick his head out of the water. The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and assist one another, given that the dolphin was the king of the sea creatures, while the lion ruled all the animals of the land. The dolphin agreed. Later on, the lion, who had long been at war with the wild bull, asked the dolphin for help. Although he wanted to help, the dolphin was unable to come out of the sea. The lion then reproached the dolphin for having betrayed him. The dolphin said in reply, 'I am not to blame! My nature is that of a sea creature, and it means that I cannot come out onto the land.'

[The same is true of people. When we form friendships with one another, we must choose allies who can come to our aid in moments of peril.]
