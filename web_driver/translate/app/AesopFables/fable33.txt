Fable 33

The Sheep and the Injured Wolf

A wolf had been mauled by dogs and had cast himself down on the ground. Because of his injuries, the wolf could not go in search of food, so when he saw a sheep, he begged her to bring him something to drink from the river that ran nearby. 'If you just give me something to drink,' said the wolf, 'I will find myself something to eat.' The sheep replied, 'But if I give you something to drink, then you will make me your dinner as well!'

[The story can be used against a wicked man who hides his plots behind a veil of pretence.]
