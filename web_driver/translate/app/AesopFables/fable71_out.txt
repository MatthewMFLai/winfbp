The Ant(螞蟻), the Pigeon(鴿子), and the Bird-catcher

An ant was thirsty(口渴的) and went down to a spring(泉) expecting to take a drink of water, but instead he found himself in danger(危險) of drowning(溺死). A pigeon snapped(哢嚓一聲折斷) off a leaf from a nearby(附近的) tree and threw it to the ant so that he could save himself by climbing up onto the leaf. Meanwhile(（與此）同時), a bird-catcher showed up and prepared his limed(酸橙（樹）) reeds(蘆葦（稈）), intending(打算) to capture(俘虜) the pigeon. The ant then bit the bird-catcher on the foot, which caused him to shake his limed reeds, warning the pigeon, who flew off to safety(安全).
