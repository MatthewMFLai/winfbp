Fable 90

The Deer and Her Friends

A deer had fallen ill and was resting on the grassy plain. When the other animals came to see her, they ate up all the grass in her pasture. As a result, when the deer recovered from her illness, she ended up dying since her pasture had come to an end.

[The fable shows that there is no benefit in having lots of foolish friends; in fact, it can be a disaster.]
