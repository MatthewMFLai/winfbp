Fable 75

The Snake and the Farmer

There was a snake who used to lurk(潛伏) around the front door of a farmer's house. One day the snake struck the man's son, biting him on the foot. The boy died on the spot. The boy's parents were filled with immense(巨大的) sorrow(悲痛) and the grief-stricken father seized(抓住) his axe and tried to kill the malevolent(惡毒的) snake. When the snake fled from his pursuer(追捕者), the man hurried(倉促的) after him, raising his weapon, determined to strike, but as the farmer was about to deal(予以（打擊）) the snake a deadly blow, he missed and managed only to cut off the tip of his tail. The man was terrified(非常害怕的) at the thought that he might have killed the snake, so he took cakes and water along with honey and salt and called to the snake, wanting to make peace with him. The snake, however, only hissed(發嘶嘶聲) softly at the farmer from where he had hidden himself in the rocks and said: 'Man, do not trouble(使煩惱) yourself any longer: there can be no possible friendship between us any more. When I look upon my tail, I am in pain. The same is true for you: whenever you look again upon the grave(埋葬處) of your son, you will not be able to live in peace(和平) with me.'

[The fable shows that no one can put aside(把…暫且放在一邊) thoughts of hatred(憎恨) or revenge(報仇) so long as he sees a reminder of the pain that he suffered(受苦).]
