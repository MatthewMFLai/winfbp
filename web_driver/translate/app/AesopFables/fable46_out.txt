Fable 46

The Wolf and the Crane(鶴)

[If you think a scoundrel(惡棍，流氓，無賴) will reward(報答；報償) you for a job well done, you are making two mistakes: first, you are helping someone who does not deserve(值得；應得) it, and second, you will be lucky(幸運的) to escape(逃脫) unharmed(未受損害的).]

A wolf swallowed(吞嚥，吞下，嚥下) a bone which got stuck in his throat. The pain was excruciating(劇烈疼痛的), so the wolf started looking for someone who could be induced(誘使；勸說) to remove the accursed(可惡的) thing in exchange(交換) for a reward. The wolf asked each of he animals if they would help him, and finally the crane was convinced(確信的) by the wolf's solemn(嚴肅的) promises(允諾，答應). Trusting(輕信的) her long beak to the wolf's gaping(（洞或者開口）大的) maw(（兇猛動物的）口部，嘴巴), the crane carried out the dangerous cure. Yet when the crane demanded(強烈要求) the promised reward, the wolf simply said, 'You ungrateful(不感激的) creature! You extracted(取出) your head unharmed from my mouth and still you ask for a reward?'
