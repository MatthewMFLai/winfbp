Fable 93

The Travellers and the Axe

Two men were walking down the same road together when one of them found an axe. 'Eureka!' he cried, 'I found it!' The one who didn't find the axe said to him, 'Don't say "I found it" -- say "we found it" instead.' A little while later the people who had lost the axe caught up with them, and when they started to chase the man who was holding the axe, he said to his fellow traveller, 'We are lost!' The fellow traveller answered, 'Incorrect! You should say "I am lost," not "we are lost," since when you found the axe you said "I" found it, not "we" found it.'

[The story shows that if people are not allowed to share in your good fortune, they will not stand by you in times of trouble.]
