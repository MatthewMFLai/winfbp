Fable 80

The Deer(鹿) and the Vine(葡萄藤)

A deer who was being pursued(追捕) by hunters hid under a grapevine. When the hunters had passed by, she turned her head and began to eat the leaves(葉子) of the vine. One of the hunters(獵人) came back, and when he saw the deer he hurled(拋) his javelin(標槍) and struck her. As she was dying, the deer groaned(呻吟聲) to herself, 'It serves me right, since I injured(傷害) the vine that saved me!'

[The fable can be used against people who are punished(懲罰) by God for having harmed their benefactors(捐助人).]
