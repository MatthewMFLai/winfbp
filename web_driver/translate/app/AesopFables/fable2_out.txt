Demosthenes and the Athenians(雅典人)

They say that during an assembly(集會；集合) in Athens, Demosthenes was prevented(妨礙；阻止) from making his speech(演說，演講，致詞), so he told the audience(聽眾，觀眾；讀者群) he wanted to say just a few words. When the audience(聽眾，觀眾；讀者群) had fallen silent, Demosthenes began his tale. 'It was summertime, and a young man had hired a donkey(驢) to take him from Athens to Megara. At midday, when the sun was blazing(燃燒的；熾烈的) hot, the young man and the donkey(驢)'s driver both wanted to sit in the donkey(驢)'s shadow(蔭；陰暗處). They began to jostle(擠；推；撞) one another, fighting for the spot in the shade(蔭；陰涼處；陰暗). The driver maintained(維護) that the man had rented the donkey(驢) but not his shadow(蔭；陰暗處), while the young man claimed(主張，斷言，聲稱) that he had rented both the donkey(驢) and all the rights thereto(向那裡).' Having told this much of the story, Demosthenes then turned his back on the audience(聽眾，觀眾；讀者群) and began to walk away. The Athenians(雅典的) shouted at him to stop and begged(退求,乞求(過去式與過去分詞)) him to finish the story. 'Indeed(（表示驚訝，諷刺，輕蔑等）真是；哦，不見得吧)!' said Demosthenes. 'You want to hear all about the donkey(驢)'s shadow(蔭；陰暗處), but you refuse(拒絕；拒受；拒給；不准) to pay attention(注意；注意力；專心) when someone talks to you about serious matters!'
