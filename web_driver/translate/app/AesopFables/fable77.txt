Fable 77

The Dog and the Gardener

A gardener had a dog who had fallen into a well. The gardener lowered himself into the well to pull the dog out, but the dog only gave the man a nasty bite, thinking that the man intended to plunge him even deeper into the water. After the dog had bitten him, the gardener said, 'It serves me right for making such an effort to pull you out of the well, when all you can do is attack me.'

[This fable indicts people who are foolish and ungrateful.]
