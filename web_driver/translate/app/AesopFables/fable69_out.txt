fable 69

The Shepherd(牧羊人) and the Lion

While he was wandering(遊蕩) in the fields, a lion got a thorn stuck in his paw. He immediately(直接地) went to a shepherd, wagging(擺動) his tail as he said, 'Don't be afraid! I have come to ask your help. I'm not looking for food.' The lion then lifted(舉起) his paw(爪) and placed it in the man's lap. 'The shepherd pulled out the thorn(刺) from the lion's paw and the lion went back into the woods(樹林). Later on, the shepherd was falsely(錯誤地) accused(控告) of a crime(罪行) and at the next public games he was released from jail(監獄) and thrown to the beasts(野獸). As the wild animals rushed upon him from all sides, the lion recognized(認出) that this was the same man who had healed(治癒) him. Once again the lion raised his paw and placed it in the shepherd's lap. When the king understood what had happened, he commanded(命令) that the lion be spared(饒恕) and that the gentle shepherd be sent back home to his family.

[When a man acts righteously(正當的), he can never be defeated by the punishments(懲罰) inflicted(使遭受) on him by his enemies.]
