Fable 65

The Donkey and the Ox(公牛)

A donkey and an ox had been yoked(使結合) together to pull a single load. The ox was making a great effort, even though he had an injury(傷害，損傷) to his horn(角), while the donkey was doing nothing to help. As the ox struggled(使勁) to pull the load by himself, he soon died. The driver then loaded the ox's carcass(屍體) upon the donkey and began beating him mercilessly(冷酷無情的). The donkey broke down and collapsed(萎陷的) under the weight, dropping dead in the middle of the road. A flock(鳥群) of birds flew up and alighted(降落) on the donkey's carcass. 'If only you had been kind enough to help the ox pull the load,' they said, 'you would not have died this untimely(不合時宜的) death, with carrion(腐屍) birds feasting(宴會) on your flesh(肉).'
