Fable 96

The Raven and the Birds

The raven pretended that it was his birthday and invited the birds to a party. Once the birds were inside, he locked the door and began to kill them one by one.

[This fable is meant for people who rush off to some merry feast but who find that things are the opposite of what they expected.]
