Fable 38

The Wolf and the Shepherd

A wolf followed along after a flock of sheep without doing them any harm(損傷，傷害；危害). At first the shepherd kept his eye on the wolf as a potential(潛在的，可能的) enemy(敵人，仇敵) to the flock(羊群) and never let him out of his sight(視界，視域). But as the wolf continued(連載的) to accompany(陪同，伴隨) the shepherd and did not make any kind of attempt(試圖；企圖；試圖做) to raid(突然襲擊；侵襲) the flock, the shepherd eventually(最後，終於) began to regard(看待；注視，凝視) the wolf more as a guardian(保護者，守護者；管理員) of the flock than as a threat(威脅，恐嚇). Then, when the shepherd happened to have to go to town, he commended(把……委託（給）) the sheep to the wolf in his absence(不在，缺席). The wolf seized(抓住（時機等），利用) his chance and attacked the sheep, slaughtering most of the flock. When the shepherd came back and saw that his flock had been utterly(完全地；徹底地；十足地) destroyed, he said, 'It serves me right! How could I have ever trusted(信任，信賴) my sheep to a wolf?'

[The same is true of people: if you entrust(信託，委託；託管) your bank deposits to greedy(貪食的；貪吃的) men, you are certain to get robbed(搶劫，劫掠，盜取).]
