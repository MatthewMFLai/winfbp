Fable 3

The Wolf, the Dog and the Collar

A comfortably plump dog happened to run into a wolf. The wolf aske the dog where he had been finding enough food to get so big and fat. 'It is a man,' said the dog, 'who gives me all this food to eat.' The wolf then asked him, 'An what about the bare spot there on your neck?' 'The dog replied, 'My skin has been rubbed bare by the iron collar which my master forged and placed upon my neck.' The wolf then jeered at the dog an said, 'Keep your luxury to yourself then! I don't want anything to o with it, if my neck will have to chafe against a chain of iron!'
