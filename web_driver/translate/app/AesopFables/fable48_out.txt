Fable 48

The Stork(鸛) and the Cranes(鶴)

[A story about a stork, urging(力勸) us not to associate(將…（與…）聯繫起來) with wicked(邪惡的) people.]

The cranes were making trouble for the farmer by snatching(奪走，搶走) the seed he had scattered(散布的) on the ground. There was a stork who associated with the cranes and lived together with them although he never did any harm to the farmer. When the farmer was fed up(感到厭煩的；忍無可忍) with the damage(損害) being done to his crops(莊稼), he prepared a snare(陷阱) and captured(俘虜) the stork together with the cranes. Thus the stork was actually held accountable(應負責任的) for crimes(犯罪活動) he had never committed(犯（罪、錯）).
