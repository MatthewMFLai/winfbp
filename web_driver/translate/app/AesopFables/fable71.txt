The Ant, the Pigeon, and the Bird-catcher

An ant was thirsty and went down to a spring expecting to take a drink of water, but instead he found himself in danger of drowning. A pigeon snapped off a leaf from a nearby tree and threw it to the ant so that he could save himself by climbing up onto the leaf. Meanwhile, a bird-catcher showed up and prepared his limed reeds, intending to capture the pigeon. The ant then bit the bird-catcher on the foot, which caused him to shake his limed reeds, warning the pigeon, who flew off to safety.

[The story shows that even dumb beasts experience fellow feeling and come to one another's aid.]
