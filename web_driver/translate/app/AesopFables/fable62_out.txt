Fable 62

The Lion and the Bear

A lion and a bear had found a fawn(幼鹿) and were fighting to see who would keep it. In the protracted(拖延的) violence of the battle they had both grown faint(微弱的) from fighting, so they called a truce(休戰) in order to rest. Meanwhile, there was a vixen(雌狐) who had been pacing(來回踱步) around them in circles. When she saw that they had fallen tot he ground with the fawn lying between them, she dashed(急奔) up, grabbed the fawn, and took off at a run. The lion and the bear were not even able to get to their feet, so they sat there watching the vixen disappear. 'What fools we are,' they said, 'for having gone to so much trouble on that vixen's behalf(為了…的利益)!'

[The fable shows that while some people do all the work, others make off with the profit(好處).]

[Note: L'Estrange's epimythium(寓意) associates(聯繫起來) this fable with the land of Gotham, the traditional abode(住所) of fools: 'Tis the Fate of all Gotham Quarrels(爭吵), when Fools go together by the Ears, to have Knaves(不誠實的人) run away with the Stakes(獎金).']
