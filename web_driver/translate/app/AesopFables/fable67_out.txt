fable 67

The Sheep, the Shepherd(牧羊人), and the Dog

A sheep once said to the shepherd, 'You shear(剪（羊毛）) us and keep all the wool(羊毛) for yourself; you like to take our milk and make it into cheese; thanks to our children, your flocks flourish(蓬勃發展) and prosper(昌盛). Yet there is no profit(益處) for us in these things. Everything we eat comes from the ground -- and what kind of blossom(小花) is there to be found on the mountain sides? The grass is dry even when covered with dew(露水). Meanwhile(（與此）同時) you nourish(養育) this dog in our midst(在…之中), feeding her on the same kind of hearty(營養豐富的) food that you yourself eat!' When the dog heard this, she said, 'If it weren't for me protecting you on every side, you would not even manage(成功做到) to get enough grass to eat! By running all around you, I ward off(擋開) the marauding(搶劫的) thief(賊) and the prowling(潛行) wolf(狼).'
