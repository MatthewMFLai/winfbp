Fable 49

The Swans and the Geese

Some swans and some geese became friends and went out onto the meadows. As they were feeding contentedly together, they were discovered by hunters. The swans, owing to the swiftness of their bodies, were immediately able to take wing and fly away. The geese, however, were naturally more heavy and so they were left behind and caught by the hunters.

[The fable represents people who are not whole-heartedly devoted to their friends but instead abandon them at the critical moment.]
