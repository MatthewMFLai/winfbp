Fable 94

Socrates had erected for himself a very modest house -- and I myself would even be willing to die as Socrates died if I could achieve an equal fame, yes, I would be willing to suffer the same public disapproval if I too could be vindicated after death! Anyway, just as you would expect on such an occasion, one of his neighbours had to ask, 'Why is it, Socrates, that someone like you would build himself such a tiny little house?' 'Ah', said Socrates, 'if only I could fill it with true friends!'

Note: The Greek philosopher Socrates was executed by the state of athens in 399BCE.
