Fable 73

The Eagle and the Farmer

An eagle was caught by a farmer, but the farmer let him go when he realized(領悟) what he had caught. The eagle did not forget this good deed(（行為), and when he saw the farmer sitting under a wall that was on the verge(邊緣) of collapsing(倒下), he snatched(搶走) the bandana(大頭巾) from the man's head, want to rouse(喚醒) the man from his seat and make him stand up. After the man set off(出發) in pursuit(追蹤), the kindly eagle dropped what he had snatched and thus fully repaid(償還) the man's good deed: the man would have been crushed(壓扁) by the wall's collapse if he had stayed there any longer. After a while the man came back to where he had been sitting and found that the upright section of the wall had fallen to the ground.
