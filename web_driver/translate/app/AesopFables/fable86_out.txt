Fable 86

The Wolf(狼), the Fox(狐狸), and the Gift(禮物)

A fox was standing not far away from a trap(陷阱), pondering(衡量) every possible approach(著手處理). A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached(靠近) her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox replied, 'Go ahead and help yourself! You're welcome to it, seeing as you are one of my very dearest(親愛的) friends(朋友們).' The wolf rushed up without a moment's hesitation(猶豫), and as he leaned(屈身) forward over the trap he released the trigger(扳機) so that the rod(杆) sprang free, striking his snout(口鼻部) and forehead(前額). 'If this is the sort(種類) of gift you give to your friends,' said the wolf, 'why would anyone ever want to be friends with you?'
