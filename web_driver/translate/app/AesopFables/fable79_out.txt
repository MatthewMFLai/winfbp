Fable 79

The Bees(蜜蜂) and the Beekeeper(養蜂人)

A thief(小偷) got into a beekeeper's property(所有物) when its owner was away and stole the honeycombs. When the owner came back and saw that the beehives(蜂巢) were empty, he stood there puzzling(令人不解的) over what had happened. The bees then came back from their pastures(牧場), and when they found the beekeeper there they attacked him fiercely(猛烈地) with their stings. The beekeeper said to the bees, 'You wretched(素質差的) creatures(生物)! You let the man who stole your honeycombs(蜂窩) get away with impunity(（懲罰、壞結果的）免除) while you direct(指向) your rage(狂怒) at me, the very person who takes care of you!'

[So too there are people who foolishly(愚蠢的) leave themselves unprotected against their enemies and push their friends away as if those friends were plotting(密謀) against them.]
