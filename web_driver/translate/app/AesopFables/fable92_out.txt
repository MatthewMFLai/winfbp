Fable 92

The Two Soldiers(士兵) and the Robber(強盜)

Two soldiers happened to fall into the clutches(掌控) of a robber: one of the soldiers ran away while the other stood his ground and defended(保護) himself with all the strength(力氣) he could muster(鼓起（勇氣）). As soon as the robber had been beaten back, the soldier's cowardly(懦夫) companion(同伴) ran up, drawing his sword and even throwing aside(在旁邊) his cloak(斗篷) as he said, 'Let me at him; I will make sure he knows who it is he has dared(膽敢) to attack!' The one who had fought with the robber replied, 'I only wish that you had been here to help me with your words; even if you did nothing more than that, I would have believed what you were saying and would have fought with even greater determination(決心). But please put away your sword and shut your useless(無用的) mouth; you might be able to fool(欺騙) people who do not know you, but I have learned by experience(經驗) with what prowess(高超的技能) you turn tail(逃跑) and run, and how unreliable(不可靠的) your courage(勇氣) really is.'

[This tale should be applied to a man who is confident(自信的) when things are going well but who proves a coward when the outcome(結果) is in doubt(不能肯定).]
