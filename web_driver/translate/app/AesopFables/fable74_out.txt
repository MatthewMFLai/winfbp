Fable 74

The Snake(蛇) and the Farmer

In the house of a certain farmer there lived a snake who regularly(定時的) came to the table and was fed on scraps(剩菜剩飯) of food. Not long afterwards(後來) the farmer grew rich, but then he became angry at the snake and tried to attack him with an axe(斧). The farmer then lost his wealth(財富) and he realized(了解) that he had prospered(成功) because of the good luck(運氣) he had gained from the snake before having wounded(受傷的) him. The farmer then begged(懇求) the snake to forgive(原諒) him for his evil deed(行為), and the snake replied, 'You are sorry for what you have done, but you must not expect me to be your faithful(忠誠的) friend until this scar(精神創傷) heals(癒合). It is not possible for me to be truly reconciled(和好) to you until all thought of that treacherous(（凶險的) axe has left my mind.'
