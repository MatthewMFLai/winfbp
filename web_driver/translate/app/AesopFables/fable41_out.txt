Fable 41

The Axe(斧，斧子) and the Trees

When a man had made an axe, he asked the trees to give him a handle made of the hardest wood. The other trees selected the wood of the wild(在野生環境中) olive(橄欖樹). The man took the handle(柄，把手) and fitted it to his axe. Then, without a moment's hesitation(猶豫，躊躇), he began to chop down the trees' mighty branches and trunks, taking whatever he wanted. The oak tree then said to the ash(白蠟木), 'It serves us right(活該), since we gave our enemy(敵人；仇敵；反對者) the handle he asked for!'

[You should think twice(兩次；兩倍) before offering anything to your enemies.]
