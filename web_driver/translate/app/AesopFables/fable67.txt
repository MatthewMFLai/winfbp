fable 67

The Sheep, the Shepherd, and the Dog

A sheep once said to the shepherd, 'You shear us and keep all the wool for yourself; you like to take our milk and make it into cheese; thanks to our children, your flocks flourish and prosper. Yet there is no profit for us in these things. Everything we eat comes from the ground -- and what kind of blossom is there to be found on the mountain sides? The grass is dry even when covered with dew. Meanwhile you nourish this dog in our midst, feeding her on the same kind of hearty food that you yourself eat!' When the dog heard this, she said, 'If it weren't for me protecting you on every side, you would not even manage to get enough grass to eat! By running all around you, I ward off the marauding thief and the prowling wolf.'
