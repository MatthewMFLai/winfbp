Fable 57

The Eagle(鷹) and the Kite(鳶)

An eagle was sitting sadly in her tree when she was joined by a kite. The kite said to the eagle, 'Why do I see you looking so sad?' The eagle replied, 'I cannot help but be sad at heart, since I need a mate who is my equal but I cannot find one anywhere.' The kite then said to the eagle, 'You should marry(嫁) me! I am even stronger than you are, which makes me the ideal bird for you.' The eagle asked him, 'Just what kinds of prey are you able to catch?' The kite said, 'Well, on several occasions(時候) I have managed to capture(俘獲) an ostrich(鴕鳥) in my talons(爪) and eat it.' When she heard this, the eagle accepted the kite's proposal and married him. After the wedding ceremony(典禮) and festivities(慶祝活動) were finished, the eagle said to the kite, 'Go and get us some of that prey which you promised.' The high-flying kite was only able to offer the eagle a nasty(糟糕的) little mouse whose flesh(肉) was all putrid(腐爛的) and rotten(腐朽的). The eagle said, 'Is this what you promised?' The kite replied, 'In order to make this most eminent(顯赫的) match with you, I had no choice but to agree to anything you asked, even if it meant promising something impossible(辦不到的).'
