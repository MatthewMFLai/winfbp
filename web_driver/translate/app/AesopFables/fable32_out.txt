Fable 32

The Wolves, the Sheep, and, the Dogs

The sheep and the wolves were at war with one another but the sheep could not be defeated(被擊敗的) because the dogs' protection(保護，防護；警戒) kept them safe. The wolves sent ambassadors(大使；使節) to the sheep, pretending(假裝的,偽稱的,嬌飾的) to offer an end to the hostilities(戰爭；戰鬥) if the sheep would let the wolves serve(為……服務) as their guardians(保護者，守護者). Hoping that this would establish(確立) an accord(協議；條約) once and for all, the sheep agreed to all the wolves' demands. Afterwards(以後; 後來), the wolves broke the treaty(條約，協定) and were able to devour(狼吞虎嚥地吃，吃光) the sheep now that they no longer had anyone to protect them. The sheep recognized their error too late and regretted(懊悔；因……而遺憾) the decision(決定) they had made.

[If you depend on someone eles for help, you will be in trouble(煩惱；憂慮) when that help is nowhere(任何地方都不) to be found.]
