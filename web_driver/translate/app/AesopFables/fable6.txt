Fable 6

The Donkey, the Priests, and the Tambourines

The Galli, those priests of the goddess Cybebe, used a donkey to carry their luggage when they went around begging for alms. When their donkey finally died, overcome by work and the whip, they stripped his hide and made themselves some tambourines. When someone asked them what they had done with their darling donkey, the priests replied, 'He thought that once he died he would get some rest, but he keeps on getting beaten just the same!'

[It is not enough that a man who is born under an unlucky star leads an unhappy life; the bitter afflication of his fate pursues him even after he is dead.]
