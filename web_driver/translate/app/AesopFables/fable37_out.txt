Fable 37

The Blind(瞎的，盲的) Man and the Cub

There was a blind man who was in the habit(習慣) of identifying(標識) any animal that was placed(放置) in his hands by touching(觸摸) it. Once they gave him a wolf cub. Even after stroking(撫，摸，捋) the animal he was not sure of its identity(身分；本身；本體), so he said, 'I am not sure whether it is the cub of a wolf or a fox(狐) or some similar creature(生物；動物), but I do know that this is not the kind of animal that should accompany(陪同，伴隨) a flock(羊群) of sheep!'

[In the same way bad people are revealed(顯示,透露顯示,透露) by their feathers(種類；品質).]
