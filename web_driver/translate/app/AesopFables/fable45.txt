Fable 45

The Bird-catcher and the Partridge

A bird-catcher had captured a partridge and was ready to strangle her right there on the spot. The partridge wanted to save her life so she pleaded with the bird-catcher and said, 'If you release me from this snare, I will lure many partridges here and bring them to you.' The bird-catcher was made even more angry by this and he killed the partridge immediately.

[The fable shows that someone who lays a trap for others will fall victim to it himself.]
