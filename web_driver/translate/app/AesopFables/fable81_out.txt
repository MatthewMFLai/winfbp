Fable 81

The Nut(堅果) Tree and the People

There was a nut tree standing by the side of the road which had a great many nuts, and the people walking along the road used to knock(撞倒) them off by throwing sticks and stones at the tree. The nut tree then said sadly, 'Woe is me(我好苦啊)! People gladly enjoy my fruits, but they have a terrible(可怕的) way of showing their gratitude(感恩).'
