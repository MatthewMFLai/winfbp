Fable 90

The Deer(鹿) and Her Friends

A deer had fallen ill(生病的) and was resting on the grassy plain. When the other animals came to see her, they ate up all the grass in her pasture(牧場). As a result, when the deer recovered(回復) from her illness, she ended up dying since her pasture had come to an end.

[The fable shows that there is no benefit(好處) in having lots of foolish(愚蠢的) friends; in fact, it can be a disaster(災難).]
