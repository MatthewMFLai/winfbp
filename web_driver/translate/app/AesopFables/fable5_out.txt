Fable 5

The Donkey(驢), the Onager(野驢), and the Lion

An onager(野驢) saw a donkey(驢) labouring(勞動的) under a heavy load and he made fun of the donkey(驢)'s enslavement(奴役；束縛). 'Lucky me!' said the onager(野驢). 'I am free from bondage(奴役；束縛) and do not have to work for anyone else, since I have grass near at hand on the hillsides(山腰，山坡), while you rely on someone else to feed you, forever oppressed(受壓迫的，受壓制的) by slavery(奴隸身分；奴役) and its blows!' At that very moment a lion happened to appear on the scene(（事件發生的）地點，現場；（戲劇等的）背景). He did not come near the donkey(驢) since the donkey(驢)'s driver(（牛、馬等的）驅趕者，牧人) was standing beside him. The onager(野驢), however, was all alone(單獨的，獨自的), so the lion attacked and devoured(狼吞虎嚥地吃，吃光) him.

Moral(道德（上）的) of the story: it shows that people who are obstinate(頑固的，固執的) and insubordinate(不順從的) come to a bad end because they get carried(入神的) away by their own sense(感覺；意識；觀念) of stubbornness(頑固，倔強，頑強) and refuse(拒絕；拒受；拒給；不准) to ask others for assistance(援助，幫助).
