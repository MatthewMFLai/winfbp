Fable 48

The Stork and the Cranes

[A story about a stork, urging us not to associate with wicked people.]

The cranes were making trouble for the farmer by snatching the seed he had scattered on the ground. There was a stork who associated with the cranes and lived together with them although he never did any harm to the farmer. When the farmer was fed up with the damage being done to his crops, he prepared a snare and captured the stork together with the cranes. Thus the stork was actually held accountable for crimes he had never committed.

[If you consort with wicked people, you will receive the same punishment they do.]
