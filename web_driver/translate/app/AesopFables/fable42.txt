Fable 42

The Pine Tree and the Wedges

Some woodcutters splitting a wild pine tree drove wedges into the trunk, prying it apart and thus making their work easier. The pine tree groaned and said, 'I cannot blame the axe, who had no connection with my root, but these utterly despicable wedges are my own children. Pounded into me this way and that, they are going to tear me apart!'

[The fable reminds everyone that the bad things that strangers do to you are never as terrible as the things done to you by the members of your own family.]
