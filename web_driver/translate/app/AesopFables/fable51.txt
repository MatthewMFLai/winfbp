Fable 51

The Hares and the Foxes

The hares were at war with an eagle and they asked the foxes to be their allies. The foxes said in reply, 'We would agree to be your allies, if we didn't know what sort of creatures you are and who you are fighting against!'

[This fable indicts people who attack someone who is more powerful than they are and thus bring ruin upon themselves.]
