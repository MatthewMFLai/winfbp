Fable 54

The Water-snake, the Viper(蝰蛇), and the Frogs(青蛙)

There was a viper who used to go to a certain spring(泉) in order to drink, but he was driven away by a water-snake who was furious(怒不可遏) that the viper would not just stay on his own turf(地盤) instead of encroaching(侵入；侵佔) on the water-snake's territory(活動範圍). Their dispute(紛爭) grew more and more fierce(猛烈的) and finally the two of them decided to fight it out, agreeing that both the water and the land would be awarded(判給) to the winner(獲勝者). When the day for the fight had been decided, the frogs came to the viper and, since they hated the water-snake, they offered(主動提出) to be his allies(盟友) and come to his aid(援助) during the battle(戰鬥). But when the battle began and the viper grappled(扭打，搏鬥) with the water-snake, the frogs just sat there croaking(呱呱地叫), since they were not able to do anything else. In the end, the viper was victorious(勝利) but he was furious with the frogs since they had failed to come to his aid as they had promised and, what was worse, they had sat there singing songs while he was doing battle. The frogs then said to the viper, 'But you should have known that we had nothing to offer you except the sound of our voices(聲音)!'
