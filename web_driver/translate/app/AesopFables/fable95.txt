Fable 95

The Cat and the Birds

The cat pretended that it was his birthday and invited the birds to a party. When the birds had come in, the cat seized the opportunity; he shut the doors of his house and proceeded to devour the birds one after another.

[This fable can be applied to people who set off with high hopes of something pleasant but who actually experience the exact opposite.]
