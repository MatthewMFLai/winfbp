Fable 70

The Lion and the Mouse

Some field-mice were playing in the woods(樹林) where a lion was sleeping, when one of the mice(鼠) accidentally(意外地) ran over the lion. The lion woke up and immediately grabbed(抓住) the wretched(不幸的) little mouse with his paw(爪). The mouse begged(乞討) for mercy(憐憫, since he had not meant to do the lion any harm(傷害). The lion decided that to kill such a tiny(微小的) creature(生物) would be a cause for reproach(批評) rather than glory(榮耀), so he forgave(原諒) the mouse and let him go. A few days later the lion fell into a pit(坑) and was trapped. He started to roar(咆哮), and when the mouse heard him, he came running. Recognizing(認出) the lion in the trap, the mouse said to him, 'I have not forgotten the kindness(仁慈) that you showed me!' The mouse then began to gnaw(嚙) at the cords(繩索) binding the lion, cutting through the strands(線) and undoing(破壞) the clever ingenuity(心靈手巧) of the hunter's art. The mouse was thus able to restore(歸還) the lion to the woods, setting him free from his captivity(囚禁).
