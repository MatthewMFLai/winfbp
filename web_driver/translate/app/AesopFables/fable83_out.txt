Fable 83

The Two Men, the Eagle(鷹), and the Fox(狐狸)

An eagle was once caught by a man who immediately(即刻) clipped(修剪過的) his wings and turned him loose(未予束縛的) in the house with the chickens. The eagle was utterly(徹底的) dejected(沮喪) and grief-stricken(極度悲傷). Another man bought the eagle and restored(使復元) the eagle's feathers. The eagle then soared(驟升) on his outspread(展開的) wings and seized(抓住) a hare(野兔), which he promptly(迅速地) brought back as a gift for the man who had rescued(營救) him. A fox saw what the eagle was doing and shouted(大聲說), 'He's not the one who needs your attention(注意! You should give the hare to the first man, so that if he ever catches you again, he won't deprive(剝奪) you of your wing feathers like the first time.'

[The fable shows that we should give appropriate(恰當的) thanks to our benefactors(捐助人), while avoiding evil-doers.]

Note: The moral added to this fable flatly(平淡地) contradicts(（指人）反駁) the moral inside the fable pronounced(宣稱) by the fox. The fox is pragmatic(講究實際的): give the reward to the wicked(邪惡的) man in order to win his favour(贊同). The editor of the fable prefers a more pious(虔誠的) rule of behaviour: good deeds(行為), not wickedness, should be rewarded(報償).
