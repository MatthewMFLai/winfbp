Fable 88

The Dog-catcher and the Dog

A man saw a dog walking by and threw him some bits of food. The dog then said to the man, 'O man, keep away from me! All your well-wishing(支持) warns(警告) me to be even more on my guard(監視).'

[This fable shows that people who offer to give someone many gifts are no doubt(懷疑) trying to deceive(欺騙) him.]

NOTE: The man in this fable is called a 'hunter' (or perhaps(可能) a 'thief', as one editor has conjectured); he appears to be a kind of 'dog thief(小偷)' or 'dog-catcher' In another version(版本) of the story, the man is a thief throwing food to a watchdog.
