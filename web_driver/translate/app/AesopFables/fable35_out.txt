Fable 35

The Shepherd(牧羊人，羊倌) and the Wolf Cub(幼獸)

A shepherd found a little wolf cub and raised(養育) it. Then, when the cub was bigger he taught it to steal from his neighbours(鄰居)' flocks. Once he had learned how to do this, the wolf said to the shepherd, 'Now that you have shown me how to steal(偷，竊取), take care that many of your own sheep don't go missing(失蹤的)!'

[The fable shows that people who are vicious(邪惡的；墮落的) by nature will often injure(傷害；損害；毀壞) their teachers once they have been taught to steal and be greedy(貪婪的).]
