Fable 33

The Sheep and the Injured(受傷的) Wolf

A wolf had been mauled by dogs and had cast(投，擲，拋，扔，撒) himself down on the ground. Because of his injuries, the wolf could not go in search of food, so when he saw a sheep, he begged(退求,乞求) her to bring him something to drink from the river that ran nearby. 'If you just give me something to drink,' said the wolf, 'I will find myself something to eat.' The sheep replied, 'But if I give you something to drink, then you will make me your dinner(晚餐；正餐) as well!'

[The story can be used against a wicked(壞的；缺德的；邪惡的) man who hides his plots behind a veil(面紗，面罩) of pretence(假裝).]
