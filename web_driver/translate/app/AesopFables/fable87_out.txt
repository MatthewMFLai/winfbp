Fable 87

The Bird-catcher and the Lark(雲雀)

A bird-catcher had set up his snare for the birds. A lark observed(看到) these preparations(準備工作) and asked the bird-catcher what he was doing. The man said to the lark that he was founding(建立) a city. The man then moved away from the snare(陷阱). The bird, believing what the man had said, approached(接近) and ate some of the bait(餌). Then, without realizing it, he was trapped(使落入圈套) in the snare. As the bird-catcher ran up and grabbed(抓取) hold of the lark, the bird said to him, 'Look here, if this is the sort of city you are founding, you won't find many inhabitants(居民) for it!'
