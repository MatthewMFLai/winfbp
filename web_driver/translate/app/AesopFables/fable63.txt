Fable 63

The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice

A snake and a weasel were fighting with one another inside a house. The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the weasel fighting with each other, they emerged from their holes and scurried around. When the weasel and the snake saw what was happening, they stopped fighting with each other and turned their attention to the mice.
