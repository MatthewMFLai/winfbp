Fable 4

The Onager(野驢), the Donkey(驢), and the Driver(駕駛員，司機；趕車者；馬車夫)

An onager(野驢) saw a donkey(驢) standing in the sunshine. The onager(野驢) approached(接近，靠近) the donkey(驢) and congratulated(祝賀；恭禧) him on his good physical(身體的，肉體的) condition and excellent diet. Later on, the onager(野驢) saw that same donkey(驢) bearing(忍耐，忍受) a load on his back and being harried(不斷煩擾，騷擾) by a driver(（牛、馬等的）驅趕者，牧人) who was beating(（尤指因處罰而）打；拍打；錘打) the donkey(驢) from behind with a club(用棍棒打；像用棍棒一樣地打). The onager(野驢) then declared(公開宣布的；公然的), 'Well, I am certainly(無疑地；必定；確實) not going to admire(欽佩；欣賞) your good fortune(好運，幸運) any longer, seeing as you pay such a high price(代價) for your prosperity (昌盛，成功)!'
