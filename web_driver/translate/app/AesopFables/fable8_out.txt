Fable 8

The Jackdaw(【鳥】穴鳥，寒鴉) and the String(線；細繩；帶子)

A man caught a jackdaw(【鳥】穴鳥，寒鴉) and tied the bird's foot with a piece of string(線；細繩；帶子) so that he could give the bird to his child as a present. The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society(社會), so when they let him loose(鬆開的，鬆掉了的) for just a moment(瞬間；片刻), he ran away. But when he got back to his nest(巢；窩；穴), the string became entangled(被纏住的) in the branches, so that the jackdaw was unable(不能的，不會的) to fly. As he was dying, the bird said to himself, 'How stupid(愚蠢的，笨的) of me! Since I could not stand being a slave(奴隸) in human society(社會), I have brought about my own death.'

[This story is appropriate(適當的，恰當的，相稱的) for people who want to rescue(援救；營救；挽救) themselves from some moderate(中等的，適度的) difficulties(困難，艱難) and, without realizing(領悟，了解) it, find themselves in even more serious(嚴重的；危急的；令人擔心的) trouble(困難；困境；麻煩的事).]
