Fable 94

Socrates had erected(建造) for himself a very modest(適中的) house -- and I myself would even be willing to die as Socrates died if I could achieve(（達到) an equal fame(名望), yes, I would be willing to suffer the same public disapproval(反對) if I too could be vindicated(澄清) after death! Anyway, just as you would expect on such an occasion(時刻), one of his neighbours(鄰居) had to ask, 'Why is it, Socrates, that someone like you would build himself such a tiny(微小的) little house?' 'Ah', said Socrates, 'if only I could fill it with true friends!'

Note: The Greek philosopher(哲學家) Socrates was executed(處死) by the state of athens in 399BCE.
