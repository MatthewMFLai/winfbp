Fable 68

The Hunting Dog and the Watchdog

There was a man who had two dogs. He taught one to hunt and the other to be a watchdog. Whenever the hunting dog caught something, the watchdog would also share in the spoils. This made the hunting dog angry at the watchdog, since he had to work for everything he had while the watchdog lived off the fruits of his labour without doing anything. The watchdog retorted, 'Don't blame me! It's our master's fault. Since he didn't teach me how to work, I only know how to eat the food that others earn.'

[Note: A similar story is associated with the legendary Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus: Lycurgus took two dogs and raised them differently, one as a hunter and one as a house dog, in order to demonstrate the degree to which education determines excellence.]
